I am a tenure-track assistant professor at the Computer Science Department, Utah State University. Prior to join USU, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Arkansas, advised by Dr. Xintao Wu. I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science at Tongji University, China. Before that, I got my bachelor and master degree from Huaqiao University, China. 

My current research generally lies in data mining and machine learning, with a focus on anomaly detection in cyberspace. The main goal of my research in recent years is to develop responsible anomaly detection models that are capable of identifying and mitigating potential abnormal behavior and threats in digital environments with the consideration of ensuring the explainability, robustness, and fairness in the loop.
