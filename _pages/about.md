I am a tenure-track assistant professor at the Computer Science Department, Utah State University. Prior to join USU, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Arkansas, advised by Dr. Xintao Wu. I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science at Tongji University, China. Before that, I got my bachelor and master degree from Huaqiao University, China. 

My current research generally lies in AI for cybersecurity, with a focus on anomaly detection in cyberspace. The main goal of my research in recent years is to develop responsible anomaly detection models that are capable of identifying and mitigating potential threats and vulnerabilities in digital environments with the consideration of ensuring the safety, robustness, and fairness in the loop.

<!-- **Research Interests**: Deep learning and its applications in anomaly detection and natural language processing. -->

<!-- <span style="color:red">**Openings**: I am looking for highly-motivated Ph.D. students (fully funded) and visiting Ph.D. students to work with me on data mining and machine learning. Please send me your CV if you are interested. [Details]({% link _pages/hiring.md%}). </span> -->
