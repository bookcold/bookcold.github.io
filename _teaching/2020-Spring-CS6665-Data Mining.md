## Course Descriptions
<!-- This course is about data mining, which aims at finding useful patterns in large data sets. However, in the era of big data, data is so large to fit in main memory.  -->
Data mining aims at finding useful patterns in large data sets. This course will discuss data mining algorithms for analyzing large amounts of data, including association rules mining, finding similar items, clustering, data stream mining, recommender systems, how search engines rank pages, and recent techniques for large scale machine learning. The goal of this class is for students to understand basic and scale data mining algorithms.

## Prerequisites
- A solid programming skill (Python is preferred)
- Basic probability and statistics
- Basic linear algebra

## Grading
- Homework (30%)
    - Six assignments involving problem-solving and programming
- Team Project (30%)
    - Students are required to participate in one [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions){:target="_blank"} as a team (up to 3 students).
    - The team project will be evaluated based on the technical soundness, presentation, and final report.
- Final Exam (40%)
    <!-- - The final exam is closed-books. -->
    
<!-- - Class Attendance (%)
    - Class attendance is not mandatory but recommended with a bonus score. -->
