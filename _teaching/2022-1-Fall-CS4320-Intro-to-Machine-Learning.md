## Course Descriptions
Application of machine learning tools, with an emphasis on solving practical problems, including data cleaning, feature extraction, and supervised and unsupervised machine learning.


## Prerequisites
- A solid Python programming skill
    - All class assignments will be in Python. 
    - The Anaconda distribution of Python is recommended
        - Please check [this](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) and [this](https://clouds.eos.ubc.ca/~phil/docs/problem_solving/01-Orientation/01.03-Installing-Anaconda-on-Windows.html) pages for guidance on installation.
    - We will use Jupyter Notebooks for the assignments, course projects, as well as in-class demos
        - If you are not familiar with  Jupyter Notebooks, please check [here](https://clouds.eos.ubc.ca/~phil/docs/problem_solving/02-Jupyter-Notebooks/02.00-Introduction.html).


## Course Material
There is no required textbook for the class.  Several introductory books cover the topics we will discuss in this course, such as [Introduction to Machine Learning with Python](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/introduction-to-machine/9781449369880/), [Python Machine Learning](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/python-machine-learning/9781789955750/), [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/).  All books are available online via the [library](https://libguides.usu.edu/c.php?g=52549&p=338608).

More advanced books include [The Elements of Statistical Learning](https://hastie.su.domains/ElemStatLearn/) (ESL) by Hastie et al., Murphy's [Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective](https://probml.github.io/pml-book/) (ML:APP), and Bishop's [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2006/01/Bishop-Pattern-Recognition-and-Machine-Learning-2006.pdf) (PRML). For books with a bigger focus on data mining, see [Introduction to Data Mining](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~kumar001/dmbook/index.php) (IDM) and [Mining of Massive DataSets](http://www.mmds.org/), or  artificial intelligence, check the [Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/) by Rusell and Norvig.
