## Course Descriptions
Data mining aims at finding useful patterns in large data sets. This course will discuss data mining algorithms for analyzing large amounts of data, including association rules mining, finding similar items, clustering, data stream mining, recommender systems, how search engines rank pages, and recent techniques for large scale machine learning. The goal of this class is for students to understand basic and scale data mining algorithms.

## Prerequisites
- A solid programming skill (Python is preferred)
- Basic probability and statistics
- Basic linear algebra
