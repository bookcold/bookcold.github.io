## Course Descriptions
Data science is an inter-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from many structural and unstructured data. Data science is related to data mining, deep learning and big data <sup>\[[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science)\]</sup>. In recent years, deep learning approaches have obtained very high performance on various data analysis tasks. This course focuses on introducing the basic deep learning approaches. The goal of this course is for students to learn how to use deep learning for solving real-world data analysis problems, especially in the fields of computer vision and natural language processing.

**Topics include:** Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Feed-forward Neural Network, Convolutional Neural Network, Recurrent Neural Network, Transformers.


## Prerequisites
- A solid Python programming skill
    - All class assignments will be in Python. 

- Basic probability and statistics
    - Understand basics of probabilities, gaussian distributions, mean, standard deviation, etc.

- Basic calculus, linear algebra
    - Be comfortable taking derivatives and understanding matrix/vector notation and operations. (e.g., matrix multiplication).

<span style="color:red">To prospective students whose major are not in computer science</span>: A solid Python programming skill is required because both homework and course project are coding-based assignments. If you do not feel confortable with programming, I would not recommend you register for this course.
